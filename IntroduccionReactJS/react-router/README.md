# React Router

The router will allow us to set up routes for each section of the website.\
Each route is an endpoint that can be entered into the browser’s location bar.\
When a route is requested, we can render the appropriate content.

Routing is the process of defining endpoints for your client’s requests.\
These endpoints work in conjunction with the browser’s location and history objects.\
They’re used to identify requested content so that JavaScript can load and render the appropriate user interface.
