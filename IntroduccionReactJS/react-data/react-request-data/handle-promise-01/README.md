# Getting Started with Create React App

This is an example of how we can handling Promises States.

HTTP requests and promises both have three states: pending, success (fulfilled), and
fail (rejected). A request is pending when we make the request and are waiting for a
response. That response can only go one of two ways: success or fail. If a response is
successful, it means weâ€™ve successfully connected to the server and have received data.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
