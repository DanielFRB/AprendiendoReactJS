# Getting Started with Create React App

This is an example of how we can Render props. This can mean components that are sent
as properties that are rendered when specific conditions are met, or it can mean
function properties that return components that will be rendered.

In this example, the four tallest peaks in Tahoe are rendered into an unordered list.
This code makes sense, but mapping over an array to render each item individually
does introduce some code complexity. Mapping over an array of items is also a pretty
common task. We may find ourselves frequently repeating this pattern.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
