# Getting Started with Create React App

This is an example of fetching with the GitHubUser Component and saving Data Locally.

We can save data locally to the browser using the Web Storage API. Data can be saved
by either using the window.localStorage or window.sessionStorage objects.

The sessionStorage API only saves data for the userâ€™s session. Closing the tabs or
restarting the browser will clear any data saved to sessionStorage. On the other hand,
localStorage will save data indefinitely until you remove it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
