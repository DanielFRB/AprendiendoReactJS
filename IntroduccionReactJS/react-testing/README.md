# React Testing

In order to keep up with our competitors, we must move quickly while ensuring quality.\
One vital tool that allows us to do this is unit testing.\
Unit testing makes it possible to verify that every piece, or unit, of our application functions as intended.

One benefit of practicing functional techniques is that they lend themselves to writing testable code.\
Pure functions are naturally testable. Immutability is easily testable.\
Composing applications out of small functions designed for specific tasks produces testable functions or units of code.

In this section, weâ€™ll demonstrate techniques that can be used to unit test React applications.
